This is the application that detects a watermark on images (further, it will also remove a watermark). 
Currently, it is just a draft version. 

How to use:
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/home
2. Upload a picture in jpeg/png format with a watermark
3. Click 'Upload File'
4. The service will process your image and return back another image where lighter pixels are supposed to show the place of the watermark.
5. The name of the image will be recorded to the database
